   ```
3. **Run the Code**:
   ```bash
   python .\server_startup.py
   ```
     
### **Running the Application**

 ```bash
  cd server
  flask run
 ```
---
## **Testing the Code**

### **Testing the shortest path algorithm**
1. **After Setup go to server and test the code (example)**:
    ```bash
    cd server
    python .\Test\run_test.py 230 Stairs Stairs --open
    ```
2. **Now change accordingly**:
   - 'T004' with the start point you want
   - '507' as the endpoint
   - 'Lift' or 'Stairs' as preference.
   - Also you can add ```
     --open``` as suffix to open the the output file in your default browser

### **Testing the Chatbot Audio Feature**
1. **After Setup first run the application**
   ```bash
   cd .\server
   flask run
   ```
   
2. **Now run imitation frontend normally**
   - Now open a new terminal tab and run the code below
   - ```bash
      cd .\server\Test\
      python .\imitation_frontend_test.py
      ```
   - *Note: That the code will record your microphone for 9 seconds and will give output in result. To check if the name of teacher was matched go to flask terminal*
